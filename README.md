# Library
The system of rent book


First of all run App.py to up the server
Then run clientLibrary.py to connect to the server
and enjoy renting books :)

NOtice :  

  1) your database file should be in the same folder of other file's folder and
     the address of the database file is in the LibraryDatabase.py (which is unique) 
     you can change it
     
  2) You can see the information of tables (such as exist members , books , ...) on the server side
  
  
  3) unfortunately we do not have captcha :(
